Homework and Lab links will launch directly into [Ohio University's JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.academic.kube.ohio.edu).
If you do not have access to that, then you can see them in the [class public repository](https://github.com/data-ohio/MATH2530_Spring23-24).

Many things will fill in or be modified as we go along, so this calendar should always be considered a draft.
